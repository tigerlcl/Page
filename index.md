## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), Information Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). 
Currently, I am supervised by [Prof. Nan Tang](https://nantang.github.io/) and co-supervised by [Prof. Yuyu Luo](https://luoyuyu.vip/).
I received my B.Eng degree in Information Engineering (minor in Computer Science) from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2020.

I was born and raised in Kunming, Yunnan. Then I moved to Hong Kong 🇭🇰 for my undergraduate study. After graduation, I worked as a Data Scientist @ [Measurable AI](https://measurable.ai/en-US/), a local startup company, for several years. I was gracefully admitted to HKUST(GZ) in Spring 2024.

## Research Interests
I focus on chat-based data preparation solutions using the Large Language Models. Below are some stunning topics I am working on:
- **Data-centric Preparation:** Extraction, Wrangling, Transformation
- **LLM-based Applications:** Prompt Engineering, RAG, Code Generation
